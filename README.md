Upishi is a meals' demo app created with Compose Web. 

Compose Web is a declarative UI framework for building web applications using Kotlin. Upishi consumes the [Meal DB API](https://themealdb.com/). The app UI has a landing page where one can view 
today's meal and the steps required to prepare it. One can view different meals from the categories section and 
finally user can view a list of desserts from the popular section.
